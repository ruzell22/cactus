We have several high severity CVEs in the project and this intends to\nfix a large batch of them by forcing the resolutions project-wide.\n2. Longer term fix is to upgrade our direct dependencies that will have\nupgraded their own direct and transitive dependencies to non-vulnerable\nversions but while we wait for all the fixes to trickle up through our\ndependency tree we need a solution that avoids having the vulnerable\nversions installed.\n3. This does not fix all the currently vulnerable dependencies of ours\nbecause some of the dependencies have not shipped a fix yet at all and\nin these cases our only other option would be to strip out the library\nand re-implement something from scratch.\n4. The dependencies which did not have a fix available I prefixed with \"x-\"\nin the root package.json's resolutions declaration so that they are there\nat least for reference and as soon as (hopefully soon) the fixes ship\nwe just need to remove the x- prefix to make it available.\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",

Currently our integration tests depend on pre-published container\nimages to be on the official registry (ghcr.io). This has pros and cons.\nThe pro is that we can pin the tests to a specific ledger version and\nthen have confidence that the test code works with that specific image.\nOn the other hand if the image itself has problems we won't know it until\nafter it was published and then tests were executed with it (unless we\nperform manual testing which is a lot of effrot as it requires the\nmanual modification of the test cases).\n2. In order to gives us the ability to test against the container image\ndefinitions as they are in the current revision of the source code,\nwe are adding here a couple of utility functions to streamline writing\ntest cases that build the container images for themselves as part of the\ntest case.\n\nAn example of how to use it in a test case:\n\n```typescript\nconst imgConnectorJvm = await buildImageConnectorCordaServer({\n    logLevel,\n});\n\n// ...\n\nconnector = new CordaConnectorContainer({\n    logLevel,\n    imageName: imgConnectorJvm.imageName,\n    imageVersion: imgConnectorJvm.imageVersion,\n    envVars: [envVarSpringAppJson],\n});\n\n```\n\nSigned-off-by: Peter Somogyvari <peter.somogyvari@accenture.com>",
